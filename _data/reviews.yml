  text: "Ralph was amazing. He went above and beyond to find the part for my vehicle and had a hell of a time getting it, but he stayed strong with his promise and got my car up and running in no time. He gave an amazing price as well. I would definitely recommend contacting him for any automotive needs, and the best part about it was not having to leave my home. 10/10! I will be back if I ever need any work done again."
